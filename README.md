## Overview

This repository implements an end-to-end solution for detecting phishing attacks using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The project is designed with MLOps best practices, enabling seamless automation of the ML lifecycle from data ingestion to model management.

## Features

- End-to-end machine learning pipeline for phishing detection
- Automated data ingestion and preprocessing
- Model training, evaluation, and tracking with MLflow
- MLOps integration for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
- Dockerized environment for reproducibility

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python
- **ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **MLOps:** MLflow, DagsHub, Docker
- **Others:** pymongo, python-dotenv

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/katta-karthik/networksecurity.git
cd networksecurity
```

### 2. Setup Python Environment
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. (Optional) Docker Setup for Local Development
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker
```

## Usage

- Run the main scripts or Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluation (customize this section based on your code structure).
- All configuration and environment variables should be set via `.env` files or directly in your environment.

## MLOps Pipeline

The MLOps pipeline is designed for:
- **Experiment Tracking:** MLflow integration for logging models and metrics.
- **Version Control:** Data and model versioning.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment:** Automated builds and deployments using GitHub Actions (or your CI/CD of choice).
- **Containerization:** Docker support for consistent environments.
